This is a js test obtained from a friend. Left it here to mark my stepping stone to learning node and express.


## Features

Below are the basic features for the application:

- user can see the existing images from folder `images` to the images list
- user can *upload image* to folder `images` and directly added to images list
- user can *add and remove image / text* from the menu to the canvas
- user can *move the image / text* around the canvas
